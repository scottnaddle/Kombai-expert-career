### Libraries in use

- **Material UI** (`@mui/material`, icons/x-packages) with **Emotion** for styling.
- **React 19** and **React DOM 19**.
- **Redux Toolkit** and **React Redux** (not yet wired up in the current entry).
- **React Router 7** (not currently used in the app root).
- **Date-fns** for date utilities.

When introducing code that uses these libs, follow the established patterns in the rest of the rules, and prefer theme-driven MUI components over custom DOM/CSS.
