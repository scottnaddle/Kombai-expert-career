### Global styles

- Base styles, fonts, and utilities live in [index.css](mdc:index.css).
- Smooth scrolling and a custom scrollbar are globally enabled.
- Utility class `.glass-effect` is available for subtle glassmorphism.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; avoid long-running animations unless guarded.
