### Sections

- Each section is presentational and is composed in [src/App.GlobalCareerLink.tsx](mdc:src/App.GlobalCareerLink.tsx) in page order.
- Use `Container` with appropriate `maxWidth` and responsive spacing.
- Prefer `Box` with `sx` for layout, using theme spacing (8px base scale).
- Keep side-effects and data fetching out of sections.
- Maintain consistent typography using theme variants.
